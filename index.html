<h1>Welcome to the website that asks <i>REAL</i> Philosophy Questions</h1>
<p>Let us begin with a simple question:</p> 
<h2> Question 1: </h2>
<p>Which item in the following image best represents "Action"?</p>
<img id="square-is-bad" src="images/mouse-coffee.jpeg" alt="picture of a computer mouse and an empty coffee mug">

<form name="Always Wrong Form" action="wrong.html" method="get">
  <div class="choices-highlighted">
      <label>which has more "action"...</label><br>
      <input type="radio" name="action" value="mouse"> Male<br>
      <input type="radio" name="action" value="coffee mug"> Female<br>
      <input type="radio" name="action" value="other..."> Other<br>
      <button type="submit">submit my choice</button>
  </div>
</form>
<br>
<h2> Question 2: </h2>
<p>What have you learned?</p>
<ul class="choices-highlighted">
  <li>a) That coffee is mighter than the sword</li>
  <li>b) That the mouse is only in "action" when it is being driven</li>
  <li>c) That this was a complete waste of time...</li>
</ul>

*(<i>what makes buzzfeed such a good website is <br>
that it exactly the kind of hyper-caffeinated,<br>
super busy visual barrage that matches both user <br>
expectations and the philosophy of the web content.  <br>
Having a top 20 countdown on a single page might be  <br>
problem for conventional news pages, but buzzfeed has a <br>
philosophy and their page layout matches that philosophy)</i> </p>
